# Synopsis

We are building a RESTFull API by following the Clean Architecture. We will do the test-driven development (TDD) with Interface and Mock. While coding, we will try to follow the SOLID Principle and, more importantly, the Dependency Injection along with Clean Code. At the end of it, we will use an ORM. The whole work will be part of a bigger microservice-architecture-based project where our work will be on the backend. We will leave the frontend as future work for the student. We will use GitHub and try to build a CI pipeline using GitHub Action. We will be using C# and .Net Core 6.0 for the implementation. We will make extensive use of class, inheritance, and interface. For database, we will do two data bases, and in mormery and MySql.
